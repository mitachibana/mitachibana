            <p class="date">25 December 2023</p>
            <p>
              Merry Christmas! So I started this basic JavaScript course called
              "Learn Programming" on 10 December. Thanks to some previous
              knowledge, I was able to finish the course today. It went by very
              quickly and I learned a lot. I am completely satisfied with the
              course. Next up is the full JavaScript course!
            </p>

              The JavaScript studies have been going well! In order to better
              understand the concepts I have learned, I programmed a quick api
              fetcher for the Revolt Chat messaging platform. My initial commit
              on GitHub is available below. The bot sends a message every day at
              21:00GMT/06:00JST with useful info fetched from various api
              sources. As time goes on, I would like to improve the bot with
              more useful commands!
            </p>

            <h2>Have restarted studies and updated roadmap!</h2>
            <p class="date">15 Dec 2023</p>
            <p>
              My busy period at work has finally come to an end! Whew! Now that
              I have had time to myself, I have been able to refocus on my
              programming studies. I am motivated more than ever! I purchased
              access to 2 online classes. The first is called
              <span class="notranslate">"Learn Programming."</span> This course
              is taught in JavaScript and it helps one learn the fundamental
              knowledge and theory with coding. In only 4 days, I have already
              completed 70% of the course. Since I already have experience with
              coding, I find it easy. That said, this course is amazing! I have
              been able to review and consolidate my knowledge. I feel like I am
              200% better at coding than I was last week.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second course I paid for was
              <span class="notranslate">"Learn JavaScript."</span> I will go
              with this program instead of the freecodecamp one I was working
              with. I absolutely love freecodecamp, and thanks to their
              wonderful HTML/CSS course, I got my start in programming. In the
              end, for JavaScript, I prefer the more in-depth explanations that
              come with <span class="notranslate">"Learn JavaScript."</span> I
              will add the links to the programs below! If you buy 2 programs
              like I did, you can get a 10% discount! I paid about 19,700JPY
              total!
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I have begun looking towards 2024. I have updated my
              <a href="https://mitachibana.com/about.html"
                ><strong>roadmap</strong></a
              >
              to include my new plans! I now plan on studying
              <strong>Tailwinds CSS</strong> in the Spring!

            <p>
              I am in the peak busy period for my work. That said, I have had to
              shelve my JavaScript studies. I really wonder if I can finish by
              my deadline of 31 December 2023. I will give it a go, however. The
              goal is to start building some tools that utilize API data and add
              them to the site. The end goal is to also learn Kotlin and start
              making apps for Android! I will be back with more soon. There is
              also a bit of content I want to add to the site!

              After working on some site formatting (sticky navbars and some

              After a few months of struggling, I finally did it. When I got
              bored with the "Responsive Web Design" course, I pushed along by
              taking a break with the material and using what I learned to build
              parts of this site. I have nothing but gratitude towards
              freecodecamp.org for their awesome curriculum! I will get started
              with the JavaScript course next week. I am definitely going to
              have my hands full...

              I did a bit of work on the site. I am trying to get a little more
              creative with the content I post. I have been working on a few PC
              upgrades. That said, while I was at it, I wrote up a guide for
              installing a GPU properly. From here on out, I will be working on
              getting articles and more media onto the site. This has been a fun
              and rewarding project so far! You can find the guide in
              resources/Tech Resources.

              In expanding the site, I thought it would be a good idea to post
              some of the lessons that I used to teach senior high school
              students in Japan. I promise that these actually worked! You can

              Although I have a few years of experience with HTML/CSS, I have
              decided to actually get certification. That said, my HTML and CSS
              self-study is going well. Finally got the flex boxes to respond
              properly based on display size! That said, things should display
              properly on any PC or mobile device! I think I am liking this
              format and will stick to it. Should be able to get things done
              smoother from here on out!

              The recently released game by MiHoYo has got me hooked. I really
